Analysis of Swarm Size Comparison (Swarm Size 20):

With a smaller swarm size of 20, the PSO exhibited faster convergence in some runs but showed more variability, as seen in `metrics_std_pso_swarm20.png`.

- **Best Fitness**: The best fitness values improved more quickly than with the larger swarm, but there was greater variability, with several runs stagnating at local optima. Fewer particles limited the swarmâ€™s exploration.

- **Swarm Distance**: The distance of the swarm center to the global optimum decreased more quickly, but fluctuations suggest premature convergence in some runs.

- **Standard Deviation**: The standard deviation of positions dropped faster than with the larger swarm, reflecting less exploration. This led to premature convergence for some runs.

- **Mean Velocity**: Particle velocities decreased rapidly, which likely contributed to reduced exploration and faster, but less reliable, convergence.

While the smaller swarm size allowed for quicker convergence, it also increased the likelihood of trapping in local optima, reducing the overall consistency of the results.
